        <p>
        The following are notes from Stage 0 of the Udacity "Intro to Programming" Nanodegree.

        <h2>How the World Wide Web works</h2>
        <p>The main type of document on the World Wide Web is <b>HTML</b>. It has all the instructions that ties everything together, whether that is images, JavaScript, or other files.</p>
        <p>The main components of the World Wide Web are: <em>HTTP</em>, the main protocol of the web; <em>Servers</em>, the computers that host the files that comprise the web; <em>the Internet</em>, the actual network; and <em>the browser</em>, the software that runs on a computer and displays files from the web.</p>
        <h2>File Types</h2>
        <p>Several types of files can be included on the web, and HTML files, as mentioned before, are the primary type of file. But other files may include images, PDFs, Word Documents, sound files, videos, or any other type of binary.</p>
        <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>HTML tags consider of a name and content. A bold tag, for example, consists of "greater than B less than", the text that needs to be bolded, and a closing tag, "greater than, slash, b, less than". </p>
        <p>Similar tags exist for italics (em), underlining (u) and there are some tags that have attributes. Attributes can be used in CSS, but they can also be used in tags like the anchor tag for creating links like this one: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></p>
        <h2>Stupid Computers</h2>
        <p>It is said that computers are <em>stupid</em> not because computers can't do smart, sophisticated things, but because computers will do what is explicitly programmed into them. This makes it so that often programmers will need to debug their code, which is to say they need to go back and review code to look for errors.</p>
